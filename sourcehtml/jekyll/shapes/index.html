<p>
    The software offers to generate various types of shapes. The description of each of them, as well as an example,
    can be found below.<br>In order to generate the shapes, we always need to generate a bigger enclosing Aztec
    Diamond. In the online version of the software, a typical computer will generate diamond up to order 100 quite
    rapidly. The desktop application is up to 10 times faster.

<h2>Plotting Options</h2>
<p>
    In order to have images that best fit your needs, options for plotting are available:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Change the colours of the dominoes.</li>
    <li>Draw the dominoes with or without a black boundary. If the order of the diamond is bigger than 50, it
    will not draw the border by default.</li>
    <li>See the shape in its enclosing Diamond.</li>
    <li>See the non-intersecting paths the diamonds are in bijection with.</li>
    <li>Draw the dominoes as lozenges. This is activated by default for Hexagon tiling.</li>
    <li>Rotate the Shape and zoom.</li>
</ul>

        it was proven that if the difference between the outer and the inner order is either even, or satisfy outer >=
        inner-1, then the shape is tileable.

        proven that the Tacnode determinantal point process appears when the size of the dominoes go to infinity such
        that the overlapping growth at a particular rate.

        Two periodic Aztec Diamonds. These are Aztec Diamonds with a non uniform probability distribution. The name
        "Two periodic" comes from the way the weights are put on the dominoes. It was introduced in
        <a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0615">Coupling Functions for Domino tilings of Aztec diamonds</a>
        by Chhita and Young. The special feature of Two Periodic Aztec Diamond is the appearance of a new phase beside
        the solid and liquid phase. This phase appears in the middle, and starts to appear clearly with diamonds of
        order 250.

        Two periodic Rectangles. This is similar to Two periodic Aztec Diamonds, except it is the tiling of a
